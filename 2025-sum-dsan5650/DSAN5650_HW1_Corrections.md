**DSAN5650 HW1 Corrections:**

[Jun 5, 11:30pm]

* **Q2.4:** The "Observation" portion should say "we observe **all 5 students** back at the starting position $x = 0$." (rather than "all 3 students")
* **Q2.4:** The trajectory given for **bouncing right** should be $(0, 1, 2, 1, 0)$, and for **bouncing left** should be $(0, -1, -2, -1, 0)$
* **Q3.1:** To be a bit more clear, option (a) should read "**Up-to-date** data on the county-wide average number of cigarettes smoked per county resident **each** day [rather than "per day"], for each county in the USA"
* **Q4.2a:** The last line (after the "Once the PGM is constructed" comment) should be `gnb.showInference(super_party_net)`, rather than just `display(super_party_net)` (since the next part asks you to "use this visualization to answer the following question", and the answer requires the prior probability tables!)
