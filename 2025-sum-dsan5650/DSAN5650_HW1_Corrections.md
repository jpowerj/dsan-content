**DSAN5650 HW1 Corrections:**

* [Jun 5, 11:30pm] **Q1.4:** The second response cell (the cell containing `weighted_diffs_by_group = None`) should have `# @title Q1.4b-response` as its first line, rather than just `# @title Q1.4-response`
* [Jun 5, 11:30pm] **Q2.4:** The "Observation" portion should say "we observe **all 5 students** back at the starting position $x = 0$." (rather than "all 3 students")
* [Jun 5, 11:30pm] **Q2.4:** The trajectory given for **bouncing right** should be $(0, 1, 2, 1, 0)$, and for **bouncing left** should be $(0, -1, -2, -1, 0)$
* [Jun 5, 11:30pm] **Q3.1:** To be a bit more clear, option (a) should read "Data on the county-wide average number of cigarettes smoked per county resident **each** day [rather than "per day"], for each county in the USA"
