**DSAN5650 HW4 Corrections**

* The name of the response variable in **Question 3.1.4** has a typo: it should be **`q3_1_4_response`** (with an `s` before the `p`) instead of `q3_1_4_reponse`!

  *(If you're working on JupyterHub, this has been auto-fixed, but I'm including it here in case your workflow involved working offline and then uploading the completed notebook back onto guhub!)*
