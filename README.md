This repo just stores `.md` (Markdown) format files containing the list of **corrections** for each assignment in each class, so that Instructors and TAs can quickly update these corrections, and the corrections will appear at the top of each student's Colab notebook file (as long as they run the first cell in the file), with a timestamp indicating how recently they fetched the corrections from this repo.
