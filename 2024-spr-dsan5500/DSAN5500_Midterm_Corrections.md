**DSAN 5500 Midterm Corrections:**

* Q2.2.1: Please change "number of collisions" to "number of collisions per slot", and then, in the code cell for the response, you can just choose one of `q2_2_1_response = "36"` or `q2_2_1_response = "18"`.
* Q3.1: If your email is for example `abc123@georgetown.edu`, then your UID is `abc123`.
* Q3.2: Subclasses of `ShopAVehicle` or `ShopBVehicle` should contain all of the functions that are in `ShopAVehicle`/`ShopBVehicle`, but the **code** within these functions can just be the Python keyword `pass`.
* Q5.2: The 3rd bullet should say "before the middle bug", and the 4th bullet should say "after the middle bug" (in the distributed version, these are reversed)
