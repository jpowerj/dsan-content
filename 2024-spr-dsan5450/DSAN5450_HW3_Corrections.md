**DSAN 5450 HW3 Corrections:** (Colab notebooks are auto-updated to incorporate these corrections)

* [*Friday, April 5, 4:30pm*] **Q3.2c** was erroneously written as a duplicate of Q3.2a. It should instead start with: "If the estimate turned out to be **positive**, i.e. if $\widehat{\beta}_{C \rightarrow R} > 0$"
