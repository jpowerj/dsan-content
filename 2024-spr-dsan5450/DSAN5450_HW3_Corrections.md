It should instead start with: "If the estimate turned out to be **positive**, i.e. if $\widehat{\beta}_{C \rightarrow R} > 0$" (if you want to update the text of the question, copy and paste the following, which will make the math render correctly:
  <pre>
    If the estimate turned out to be **positive**, i.e. if $\widehat{\beta}_{C \rightarrow R} > 0$
  </pre>
