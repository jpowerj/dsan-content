**DSAN 5450 HW2 Corrections:** (Colab notebooks have been auto-updated to incorporate these corrections)

* *(2024-02-19, 8pm EST)* In the instructions for Q1.3a through Q1.8, the language should be changed from "which of the following two criteria would be appropriate" to "which of the following criteria would be *most* appropriate". *(Thank you to Matt for pointing this out!)*
