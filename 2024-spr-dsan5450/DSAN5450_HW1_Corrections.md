**DSAN 5450: HW1 Corrections / Clarifications**

*(Note: If you are working in **Colab** alone, these updates are automatically applied (at the time given in the timestamps for each bullet point below). This listing is just in case (a) you want to update an answer in light of a correction/clarification, or (b) you are **downloading** the notebook to work offline, in which case you'll need to manually update your local copy)*

* (2024-02-01, 5:30pm EST) Questions 3.3a, 3.3b, and 3.3c should have an additional option "Indeterminate". If you update the Q3.3a-response cell to be: `q3_3a_response = "" # @param ["", "True", "False", "Indeterminate"]`, and similarly for Q3.3b-response and Q3.3c-response, the "Indeterminate" choice should then appear as one of the options in the dropdown box for these questions.
