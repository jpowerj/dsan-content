**DSAN 5450: HW1 Corrections**

* (2024-02-01, 5:30pm EST) Questions 3.3a, 3.3b, and 3.3c should have an additional option "Indeterminate". If you update the Q3.3a-response cell to be: `q3_3a_response = "" # @param ["", "True", "False", "Indeterminate"]`, and similarly for Q3.3b-response and Q3.3c-response, the "Indeterminate" choice should then appear as one of the options in the dropdown box for these questions.
