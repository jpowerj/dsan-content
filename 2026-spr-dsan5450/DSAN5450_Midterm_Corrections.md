**DSAN 5450 Midterm Corrections:**

* On line 5 of the cell with title `Q4.2b-response`, replace `"integer"` with `"number"`, then Colab will allow you to type in a decimal answer (this is the only part requiring a decimal response!)
* On this same question, replace "lower than" in the instruction text with "greater than" (otherwise the question is a bit strange, though you could type in a negative number to answer it as-is – we will take the **absolute value** when grading this part of the question!)
