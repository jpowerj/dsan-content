**DSAN 5450 Homework 1 Updates**

* The "alternate" set of questions for Part 3 can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aCw5o930sGMKBBE11yQqC7u2xBNUSrYY?usp=sharing) (the linked notebook is read-only, but you can copy-and-paste the cells into this notebook!)
* In Part 3.2, you should round the "December Danger Factor" to **two decimal places**, **not** to the nearest whole number (the whole-number-rounding was from a previous draft of the question, which no longer makes sense!)
