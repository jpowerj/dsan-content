**DSAN 5450 Homework 1 Updates**

* [Tuesday, Feb 3] The requirement for Q4.12 has been lowered from **90%** to **80% accuracy** (you can get above 90% using e.g. [`AdaBoost`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier.html) or a [Multilayer Perceptron](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html) model, but that's not the focus of this class, and 80% should be achievable using just `RandomForestClassifier`)
* The "alternate" set of questions for Part 3 can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aCw5o930sGMKBBE11yQqC7u2xBNUSrYY?usp=sharing) (the linked notebook is read-only, but you can copy-and-paste the cells into this notebook!)
* In Part 3.2, you should round the "December Danger Factor" to **two decimal places**, **not** to the nearest whole number (the whole-number-rounding was from a previous draft of the question, which no longer makes sense!)
