**DSAN 5450 HW3 Corrections:**

* [Apr 1, 4:30pm] In Question 3.4, reference to **Q3.2c** should be replaced by reference to **Q3.2a**. Meaning, the second paragraph should start with:

  > "**Assume** for this question that we're in the scenario of **Q3.2a** (that $\widehat{\beta}_{R \rightarrow C} \lt 0$)"
